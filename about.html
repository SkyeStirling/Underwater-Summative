              <h2> History </h2>
               <br> <br>
              <p> The Wellington Underwater Club (WUC), officially established in 1951,
                is thought to be the oldest dive club in New Zealand. An extract
                from the 25th Jubilee celebrations held in August 1976 reveals:  </p>

              <p> It all began when a hardy pioneer noticed he wasn't the only diver on the beach.
                 Each, from thinking he was the only one, suddenly realised that there were 20
                 or more people actively diving around the Wellington coast. These divers
                 used largely home-made equipment and seldom had to venture further afield
                 that the road's end or the tram terminal to get full and easy catches of
                 crays, moki, butterfish and paua </p>
                 <br>

              <p>  By the summer of 1950/51 they were meeting for informal group dives
                often enough that a club seemed logical. Once the idea was mooted and word
                got around, the level of interest was surprising. Apart from local pioneers,
                there were people who had dived in the islands during the war or while serving
                at met. stations, and who wondered what diving was like at home. Deerstalkers
                and other huntsmen fancied the idea of similar sport without the hassle of
                tramping miles into the mountains. Surfers and swimmers also fancied a take-
                home profit from their aquatic activities. So the Club was born - the first,
                we like to think, in New Zealand. </p>

              <h2> People </h2>
              <br> <br>
              <p> A club is about the people. It is about people that share an interest
                and support the individuals in within this community. Diving in a group
                with dive buddies, doesn't only make this sport safer it also makes it
                more enjoyable, and also affordable. In the early days the divers in
                the club would share their ideas and develop new gear that wasn't
                available to buy or way too expensive. Nowadays we still share costs
                for dive trips and can help eachother out when gear fails at the
                dive site. But most importantly we can share the amazing
                experiences we have with our friends. </p>

                  interest in the underwater world and how Wellington Underwater
                  Club provided the right setting for their activities. </p>
